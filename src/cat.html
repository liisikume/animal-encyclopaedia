            Cats are fascinating creatures with many unique traits and behaviors. They spend a significant portion of their lives sleeping,
            often around 12-16 hours a day, to conserve energy for hunting in the wild. Their communication with humans is also unique;
            they use a combination of vocalizations like meowing and purring, as well as body language and eye contact, to express their
            needs and emotions. Furthermore, their whiskers, known as <i>vibrissae</i>, are highly sensitive tactile hairs that help them detect
            even the slightest changes in their environment, aiding in navigation and spatial awareness.</div>
        <div class="column">
            One distinctive feature of cats is their retractable claws. Unlike dogs, cats can keep their claws sharp for hunting and
            climbing by retracting them when not in use, which also allows them to walk quietly and stalk prey more effectively. Cats
            possess an extraordinary sense of smell, about 14 times stronger than that of humans, enabling them to identify food, other
            animals, and mark their territory. Historically, cats were domesticated around 9,000 years ago and were revered in ancient
            Egypt, where they were associated with the goddess Bastet and killing a cat was punishable by death.</div>
        <div class="column">
            Cats are also known for their incredible agility and grooming habits. They can jump up to six times their body length, thanks
            to their powerful leg muscles, making them excellent hunters and climbers. Grooming is an essential activity for cats, helping
            them regulate their body temperature, distribute natural oils throughout their fur, and keep themselves clean from dirt and
            parasites. Purring, often a sign of contentment, can also occur when cats are in pain or distressed, demonstrating the
            complexity of their behaviors and emotional expressions.</div>
