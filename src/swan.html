            Swans are majestic birds known for their grace and beauty, often symbolizing love and purity in various cultures.
            These large waterfowl belong to the family <i>Anatidae</i>, which also includes ducks and geese. Swans are characterized
            by their long necks, robust bodies, and large wingspans, which can reach up to 10 feet in some species. They are
            typically found in freshwater lakes, rivers, and ponds across the Northern Hemisphere, though some species
            inhabit the Southern Hemisphere as well. Swans are also known for their striking white plumage, although some
            species, like the Black Swan native to Australia, have dark feathers.</div>
        <div class="column">
            One of the most remarkable aspects of swans is their monogamous nature. Swans are known to form strong, lifelong
            pair bonds with their mates, often remaining together throughout their lives. This commitment to their partners
            is accompanied by elaborate courtship rituals, including synchronized swimming and mutual preening. Swans work
            together to build nests, usually in secluded areas near water, and both parents take turns incubating the eggs
            and caring for the cygnets (young swans) once they hatch. This cooperative parenting ensures high survival rates
            for their offspring and strengthens the bond between mates.</div>
        <div class="column">
            Swans are not just symbols of beauty and romance; they also play important roles in their ecosystems. As
            herbivores, swans primarily feed on aquatic vegetation, which helps maintain the health of their wetland
            habitats by preventing overgrowth. Their foraging behavior also creates open water spaces that benefit other
            wildlife. Despite their serene appearance, swans can be quite territorial and aggressive, especially during the
            breeding season. They use their strong wings and beaks to defend their nests from potential threats, including
            other swans and predators.</div>
